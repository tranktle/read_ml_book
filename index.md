This is my note written when I read the book The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition" by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman. Here is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576">link to the book</a> .
